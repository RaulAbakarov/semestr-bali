    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqQ1": "What formula does the calculator use?",
    "faqA1": "The calculator works according to the standard grading system of universities in Azerbaijan. Formula: (Seminar average × 0.4 + Colloquium average × 0.6) × 3 + Attendance + Independent work (0-10). Maximum score is 50.",
    "faqQ2": "How is the attendance score calculated?",
    "faqA2": "The attendance system works based on rules for absent hours. Each course has specific allowed absence limits and score tables based on total hours (30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105). For example, in a 60-hour course: 1 absence=10 points, 2-3 absences=9 points, 4-7 absences=8 points. If you have 8 or more absences, you are not allowed to take the exam.",
    "faqQ3": "How are seminar and colloquium scores considered?",
    "faqA3": "The average of seminar grades is multiplied by 0.4, while the average of colloquium grades is multiplied by 0.6. This shows that colloquiums have more weight. Then these two numbers are added and multiplied by 3 to get a maximum of 30 points.",
    "faqQ4": "Which universities is this tool suitable for?",
    "faqA4": "This calculator is currently designed for Baku State University (BSU). The grading system applied at other universities may differ and results may not be accurate.",
    "faqQ5": "How is the accuracy of calculations ensured?",
    "faqA5": "The calculator is programmed according to official university rules. All calculations are performed locally in your browser in a transparent manner. No personal information is collected or sent to servers. You are responsible for the accuracy of the information you enter.",
    "faqQ6": "Does it work on mobile devices?",
    "faqA6": "Yes, the site is fully responsive and works perfectly on all devices (phone, tablet, computer). The user interface is specially optimized for mobile screens."
